This code takes a list of animals, either dogs or cats, and outputs some data on them.

The task is to implement generics by separating the get[animal]trainingprioritylist and get[animal]sorted functions into an abstract generic class. In this sample code we created a class AnimalEntity.ts that has static generic functions.
